# Countdown timer 
## By Nathaniel Ryan Mathew, Shashank and Shravan
Nathaniel Ryan Matthew did the **HTML** and Shashank did the **CSS** part.As I'm willing to do **JavaScript** I've chosen to do it.
But because I'm a beginner Nathaniel Ryan Matthew Helped Me in Coding **JavaScript**.There were initial bugs like Counter Timer Counted Negative Values too or text field is not a *readOnly* I've fixed those bugs. We've also added images to the buttons. The Text(*Counting down* and *By SOSC*) is written in Ubuntu font.
*Note:The Input fields doesnt take values more than 90(except for the **hour** field)*
